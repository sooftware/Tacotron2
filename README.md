This implementation focuses as much as possible on the readability and extensibility of the code and the reproduction as it is in the paper (without Wavenet). I would appreciate it if you could feedback or contribution at any time if there was a mistake or an error.
  
## Installation
Currently we only support installation from source code using setuptools. Checkout the source code and run the
following commands:  
```
pip install -e .
```
